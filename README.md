# files2details.sh

A simple shell script to read text files from a folder, convert them to html \<details\> elements and produce a html snippet file as output, so it will look like this:  

<details><summary>file 1</summary>file content</details>
<details><summary>file 2</summary>file content</details>
</br>

Uses [txt2html](http://txt2html.sourceforge.net) for the conversion.  
The code of includeHTML.js is copied from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_include.asp).  
Otherwise this is free software released into the public domain.
