# files2details

A simple shell script to include files as html \<details\> elements in a static html page, so it will look like:

<details><summary>file 1</summary>file content</details>
<details><summary>file 2</summary>file content</details>


Uses [txt2html](http://txt2html.sourceforge.net) for the conversion.


This is free software released into the public domain.
